// TODO:

// Big functions:
// Porn detection
// URL redirection
// Real-time updates


// Mockups of the app (we aren't doing a chrX anymore...new approach to design) LATER

// CURRENTLY::

// √ When I click on a list item, I should go to a new website
// √ When I click the website, I should go to the website url that is in the name
// √ Opening links shouldn't hijack me out of my current window (opens in new tab)
// √ Enable random selection from list of links to open when visiting a porn site (oh true, first i gotta save the links somewhere)
// √ The data should persist

// o I should be able to delete urls

// o Rotate the text in the url input to display ideas and inspiration for users LATER
// o I must screen the input links so that the user experience will be seamless and great LATER
// o What happens when a person inputs a banned link into the redirect url list??? ABOVE
// o Instruct users to enable the extension in Accessibility services upon download
// o Open a survey when app is deleted (how ?)
// o I should be able to add urls with custom names (titles seperate from the links)

// o use keyword analysis to determine if a website is adult upon visit so that i
//    can finally stop having to look at porn sites
// o Enable realtime updates of banned urls through Firebase
// o The links should be written to a personal database (Firebase DB) for me to screen
// o Test sync persistence between updates and diff machines PREMIUM PRICE LOOOOOLLLLLL
// o Add an "emergency button" where ALL LINKS and QUALITY EDUCATION are opened
// o Screen all inputted redirect urls with the realtime urls
//   If any are of illegal domains, delete them

// o Explain what data I do and don't collect

// o How to ensure people open the popup long enough for firebase to work....?

// o There must be a "how to use" section in the popup and another "about PorNo!" site -- implement

// o Add links to quality education

// o Add a place to contact me about links that bypass the filter and other issues in the popup

// o Add link to  a quiz in the popup

// o Publish

// o marquee and promo photos

// o Make a how-to youtube video / trailer

// MyAccessibilityService.java - URL check and redirect, URL capturing in a different file
// Some java class that handles the saving and reloading of the links to sharedprefs (how about firestore, for money lol ?)

// A class, linkAdapter, that handles the list populating and operations
